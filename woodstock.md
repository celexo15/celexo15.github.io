_Woodstock Then and Now_ is a first-hand transcription of a series of roundtable discussions and interviews with "Woodstock luminaries" held at the Berklee College of Music in April 2019. Here, the words of Michael Lang (Woodstock co-founder), Chip Monck (emcee, lighting and stage designer), Bill Hanley (audio engineer), Henry Diltz and Elliott Landy (photographers), Rona Elliot (public relations), and Gerardo Velez (percussionist for Jimi Hendrix) are presented for scholars and fans alike. Meeting all together for the first time since 1969, these luminaries shared Woodstock stories, talking about the impact of the festival on their careers and society as a whole.
